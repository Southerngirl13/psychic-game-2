## About

Simple JavaScript game that allows user to guess the letter the computer chooses.
Choose a letter from A - Z and test your psychic ability to see if you can read a computer's mind!
This game was built with regular JavaScript.

It's hosted online. It can be played on the browser [here](https://southerngirl13.github.io/psychic-game-2/).

## Instructions
The computer will randomly choose a letter from the alphabet. 
The goal is for the user to guess that letter by pressing a key on the keyboard. 

The user is allowed 9 chances to guess the correct letter. 
The game will display each incorrect guess the user makes.

The game will prevent the user from making any guesses that aren't letters a - z.
The game will also prevent the user from repeating previous guesses. 
Neither of these mistakes will count as one of the user's 9 chances. 

Each time the user guesses a letter correctly, their win count increases by one.
If they fail to guess the correct letter in 9 chances, their losses count increases by one.

Each time the user wins or loses, the game will restart without reloading the page.
